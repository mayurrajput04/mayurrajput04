Not chasing stars or followers.  
Just chasing logic â€” the kind that hides between the lines of smart contracts.

## What I'm Up To

- Rebuilding real-world hacks just to see if I can  
- Writing tests that ask: "What if the attackerâ€™s smarter?"  
- Breaking contracts I built yesterday  
- Deep diving into DeFi, rebase tokens, stablecoins, and vault logic

I use **Foundry like a blade** â€” fast, sharp, and straight to the point.  
No fluff, no bandaids. Just logic.

## Why Iâ€™m Here

Im here to be a "top auditor."  
Also helping make protocols a little harder to break.

If it compiles, good.  
If it survives me trying to break it, better.

## ðŸ¥· Gintoki Rules Apply

Lazy on the outside. Dangerous when it matters.

If you're into clean code, messy bugs, and silent logic wars â€” welcome.
