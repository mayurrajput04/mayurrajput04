Not chasing stars or followers.  
Just chasing logic — the kind that hides between the lines of smart contracts.


## What I'm Up To

- Rebuilding real-world hacks just to see if I can  
- Writing tests that ask: "What if the attacker’s smarter?"  
- Breaking contracts I built yesterday  
- Deep diving into DeFi, rebase tokens, stablecoins, and vault logic

## Why I’m Here

Im here to be a "top auditor."  
Also helping make protocols a little harder to break.

If it compiles, good.  
If it survives me trying to break it, better.

If you're into clean code, messy bugs, and silent logic wars — welcome.
